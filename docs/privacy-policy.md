Sushi - SSH Client is an Android application for connecting to SSH servers and, optionally, using Google services for voice input, command generation, and log uploads.

## Data we collect
- User-provided inputs such as SSH connection details, commands, and settings stored on your device.
- If you enable Gemini, the text of your request is sent to the Google Gemini API using your API key.
- If you use voice input, your device's speech recognition service processes audio to produce text. This is typically provided by Google on Android devices.
- If you enable Google Drive log uploads, session log text is uploaded to your Google Drive account.

## How we use data
- To connect to SSH servers you configure.
- To generate command suggestions when Gemini is enabled.
- To upload logs to Google Drive when you enable that feature.

## Data sharing
- We do not sell or share your data with third parties for marketing.
- Network requests are made only to services you enable (your SSH servers, Google Speech, Google Gemini, Google Drive).

## Permissions
- INTERNET: required for SSH, Gemini, and Drive features.
- RECORD_AUDIO: required only for voice input. Voice input is optional.

## Data retention
- App settings and logs are stored locally on your device.
- If you upload logs to Google Drive, those logs are stored in your Google Drive until you delete them.

## Children
This app is not directed at children.

## Changes
We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will be published at this URL.
